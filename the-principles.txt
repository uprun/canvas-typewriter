1) functions should be small (40 lines top) and 100 chars per line max, ideally
2) if it takes more than one day to implement, I took wrong direction [2023-02-02]
3) "The root of all evil is premature optimization" Dijkstra
4) if there are too many statements - something is wrong with the design or with requirements
5) just save the whole document on every commit [Ctrl|Cmnd + Enter]
[deleted] 6) don't waste time on small issues [ kinda true but not relevant]
[deleted] 7) this is just text editor on canvas from now  [not relevant anymore]
8) if development takes too much time - reduce scope // explanation to [7) just text editor on canvas]
9) if there is an "AND" or "OR" in the function name - something is wrong
10) real-time design is very cool // live syncronization as an example
11) Manipulations with files should be authorized each time
12) when you have limited resource or just limitation you can design more diverse and interesting solution
13) iterative design is much better than from groun-up design
14) everything must be easy readable [I need to redo these principles]
